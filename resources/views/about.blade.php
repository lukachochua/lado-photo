                I used to be a freeskier and a rugby player later. After very successful professional athlete carrier, I
                decided to find something I'm equally passionate about, something that'd keep me inspired, and so I got
                into photography and I love it! There's nothing greater and more rewarding than finding new and
                innovative ways to pour light on something of your own imagination, touching people's perception,
                leaving memories. It's a fantastic process that I feel lucky to participate in.
                When I'm not working I'm usually doing some sports (gym, boxing, rugby or any sports activity), hanging
                out with friends or my English Bull Terrier Grimmjaw.
                I'm very much a kid at heart, I believe in good, I love to socialize, meeting new people and travel
                whenever I can. So feel free to say hello and share a story with me.
